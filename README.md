# Excel to database script
This sample script takes data from Excel and adds it to an SQL database. This is just an initial iteration and there is room for several improvements.

## How to run the script?
1. Setup Python Poetry (used to manage project dependencies.)
2. Run `poetry shell` to create a virtual shell.
3. Run `poetry install` to install the dependencies.
4. Run `poetry run python ./src/main.py` to run the script.

**Ensure DB is created and running before executing the script.**
